      As a software developer, I worked on a CRM project using Node.js, Nest.js,
      Docker, MySQL, and Vue.js technologies. My responsibilities included
      designing and implementing features, creating and maintaining databases,
      and developing front-end user interfaces. I also collaborated with the
      team to ensure that the project was completed on time and within budget.
      My proficiency in these technologies allowed me to create a robust and
      efficient CRM system that improved customer relations and increased sales.
