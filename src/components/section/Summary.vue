      I possess a strong skill set in web development, with a focus on
      server-side technologies and databases. My expertise lies in Node.js,
      Nest.js, Express.js, and the development of RESTful APIs. Additionally, I
      have experience working with both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. With
      these skills, I am well-equipped to build scalable and efficient web
      applications, ensuring robust backend functionality and seamless data

      for projects that require backend development and API design.
